# Overview

This is a full-stack Notes App built with TypeScript, utilizing Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and a front-end built with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. The app allows users to create, update, and delete notes within different folders.

The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of TypeScript by implementing it in a practical project. Through this project, I aimed to explore the following:

- TypeScript features such as strong typing, interfaces, and classes to improve code clarity and maintainability.
- Frontend interaction using TypeScript to manage dynamic behaviors and asynchronous requests within a user interface.

I was also able to deepen my understanding of backend development and creating web services using TypeScript.
